## KPT

### Keep

- Enjoyed experiment with lab members. 

### Problem and Try

- Spend a lot of time to make the calculation faster
  - Instead of spending time on speeding up, I should do other work in the waiting time.

## Free Space

Apparently, tomorrow is the school festival. I'm not going, though.
