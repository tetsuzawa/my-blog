# Daily Report

## Task Summary

- Organizing and analyzing the results of experiments to be written for the paper.
- Routine task
  - [x] Learning English

## Done

- Watch
  - System Design: TikTok
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07BVxmVFDGY&t=1893s
    - Store 3 kind of data
      - User Data: RDB
      - Video MetaData: KVS
      - Video: Storage service
        - Deliver them by CDN
          - Better performance if we have to deliver it globally
          - Avoid creating a single point of failure.
    - How to make a multiple kind of resolution videos.
      - For multiple devices which is desktop, smartphone and something like that.
      - Pipeline system 
      - Scalable
- Tail Recursion
  - incur no extra stack
  - it prevents the stack overflow

  
  

## Note

- binomial numbers
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/solution/
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient
    - binomial cofficient
    - nCr = (n;k) = n! / n!(n-k)!
- Catalan number
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/solution/
  - prod^n_k=2 n+k/k

## Interruption at work

- nothing

## Coding Test

### Unique Binary Search Trees II
https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/253/conclusion/2384/

#### Whiteboard

n = 7

l <= n <= r


```c++
vector<TreeNode*> generateTrees(int n) {
    
        for (int i =0;i<)
}
````

int find()
        

### Review

## What to do tomorrow

- Research
  - Check the result of pre-experiment and compare it to 0, 45, 90
  - Look for the data obtained by constant method.

## KPT

### Keep

- I took notes frequently.

### Problem and Try

- I tried to solve a problem I didn't understand and fell asleep without writing a daily report.
  - I shold switch to time-driven life instead of task-driven life.

## Free Space

Finished learning recursion, yet there are problems which I couldn't solve.
But for now, I am going to move forward to make progress.
