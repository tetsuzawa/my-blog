# Daily Report

## Task Summary

- Organizing and analyzing the results of experiments to be written for the paper.
- Routine task
  - [x] Learning English

## Done


- Research
  - Meeting and discussed paper. 
  - Create tex template.
- Reading
  - [devision by two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_two)
    - division by two can be performed by a bit shift operation that shifts the number one place to the right.
- Watching
  - PiyoConf
  - I got interested in browsers.
  




## Note

- count_bet_set
  ```c++
  int count_set_bit(int num) {
    if (num == 0) return 0;
    return (num & 1) + count_bit_set(num >> 1);
  }
  ```

## Interruption at work

- nothing

## Coding Test

- skipped

## What to do tomorrow

- Research
  - Check the difference between CW and CCW 
    - create a graph 
  - Check the result of pre-experiment and compare it to 0, 45, 90
  - Look for the data obtained by constant method.

## KPT

### Keep

- I was able to proceed with the work without feeling excessive pressure.
  - Maybe it's because I didn't study coding tests.

### Problem and Try

- I felt that I had wasted too much time.
  - Stop chatting too much

## Free Space

Winter is coming.
(Really??)
