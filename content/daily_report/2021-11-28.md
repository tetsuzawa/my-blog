# Daily Report

## Task Summary

- Working on a webapp for an online sound image localization experiment that will be used to collect experimental results for a paper due on December 20.
- Routine task
  - Learning English
  - Coding Tests

## Done

## Note

- Coding test
  - How to make progress
    - Easy
      - We should pick 5-6 questions from each topic and try to master basics of the topic to have a breadth.
      - If I feel confident to solve easy problem, then go on to mediums. That will be asked mostly in interviews.
    - Medium
      - We should pick like 10 problems from each topic
      - Learn the advanced data structure
  - How to solve problems
    1. Clarify the problem to completely understand it
       - Clarify
       - Ask if I needed
       - Repeat to read or listen
       - Write it down.
    2. Thought out loud constantly
       - (to show the thinking process in the actual interview)
       - (to demonstrate my knowledge)
    3. Think through what I do
       - Better, faster, quicker, more efficiently.
       - Ultimately I feel like I am on the spot where I can code it.
    4. Coding
       - (take a note what I don't know)
    5. Test it in real time.
       - Ask some example cases
       - Think about edge cases 
        

## Interruption at work

## Coding Test

- What did you solve?
  - Summary
  - Details
- Did you find it comfortable to solve?
  - What do you think caused it? Language? Algorithms?
- How did you read the problem text? Quickly? Carefully?
  - Which is better do you think?
