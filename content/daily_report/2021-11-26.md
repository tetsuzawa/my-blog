## Note

- px, em, rem 
  - px fixes element size absolutely
    - It causes degradation of accessibility
  - em is a unit based on the font-size of the element itself.
    - The default font-size on HTML is 16px. Since 1em = 16px basically.
  - rem is also a unit based on the font-size. there is a difference between em and rem. rem is based on a root element.
- z-index
  - It specifies the stack order of an element
