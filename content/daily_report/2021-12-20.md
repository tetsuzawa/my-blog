# Daily Report

## Task Summary

- Data analysis on my study.
- Routine task
  - [ ] Learning English

## Done

- [x] Check the deviances are normally distributed
  - [x] Visualize distribution.
- [doing] Summarize the results of subject selection.
  - [x] Generated chart of point plot.
- [pending] Create a web app for online experiment.

## Note

- SQL Antipatterns
  - Why time complexity of join is exponential?
    - On MySQL5.6
      - Nested Loop Join algorithm is used for non-indexed columns.
        - Why NLB is used for non-indexed columns?
          - Unnecessary
      - Block Nested Loop Join algorithm is used for indexed columns.
        - falster
        - Join Buffer Size
          - default 256 kilo bytes
          - max 4GB -1
        - By using buffer, it reduce the calculation cost
  - Polymorphic Associations (Promiscuous Association)
    - {{< figure library="true" src="daily_report/polymorphic_association.jpeg" title="Polymorphic Associations" >}}
    - ```sql
      CREATE TABLE Comments (
        comment_id    SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        issue_type    VARCHAR(20), -- 'Bugs' or 'FeatureRequests',
        issue_id      BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        author        BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        comment_date  DATETIME,
        comment       TEXT,
        FOREIGN KEY (author) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id)
      )
      ```
    - It may cause metadata contamination.
    - Solution
      - Reversing dependency.
      - Use cross tables.
      - {{< figure library="true" src="daily_report/polymorphic_association_cross_reference_tables.jpeg" title="Cross Reference Tables" >}}
      - It does not prevent duplication of multiple associations, which needs to be handled by the application code.
      - COALESCE (SQL-92 compatible)
