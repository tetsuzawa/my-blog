# Daily Report

## Task Summary

- Organizing and analyzing the results of experiments to be written for the paper.
- Routine task
  - [ ] Learning English

## Done



## Note

- DP technique
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/solution/
  - Memoization
    - no side effects
    - recursive function for a top-down solution
  - Tabulation
    - bottom-up
    - iterative
- LRU Cache
  - https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/lru-cache
  - LRU Cache is often implemented by pairing a doubly linked list with a has map.
  - space O(n)
  - get least recently used item O(1)
  - access item O(1)

## Interruption at work

- nothing

## Coding Test

### Longest common subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/

#### Whiteboard

- constraints
  - `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
- edge cases
  - if text1 = "" then return 0
  - if text2 = "" then return 0
- cases
  - abcde, ace
    - the answer will be ace
  - abc, def
  
  | a | b | c | d |
 a|
 b|


### Review

- Could you solve it?
  - No
- Understood the solution

## What to do tomorrow

- Research
  - Check the result of pre-experiment and compare it to 0, 45, 90
  - Look for the data obtained by constant method.

## KPT

### Keep

- I watched a youtube of system design
  - took a note immediately
  - did it at top priority.
