## Task Summary

- Organizing and analyzing the results of experiments to be written for the paper.
- Routine task
  - [ ] Learning English

## Done


## Note

- Dynamic Programming
  - Brake down the problem into "overlapping subproblems"
  - The problem has an obtimal substructure
  - Greedy problems have optimal substructure, but not overlapping subproblems.
  - Divide and conquer algorithms break a problem into subproblems, but these subproblems are not overlapping.
  - characteristic of common DP
    - first
      - What is the minimum cost of doing...
      - What is the maximum profit from...
      - How many ways are there to do...
      - What is the longest possible...
      - Is it possible to reach a certain point...
    - second
      - the future "decisions" depend on earlier decisions.
  

## Interruption at work

- Assignment: 1.5 hours

## Coding Test

### Unique Binary Search Trees II
https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/253/conclusion/2384/

#### Whiteboard

n = 7

l <= n <= r


```c++
vector<TreeNode*> generateTrees(int n) {
    
        for (int i =0;i<)
}
````

int find()
        

### Review

## What to do tomorrow

- Research
  - Check the result of pre-experiment and compare it to 0, 45, 90
  - Look for the data obtained by constant method.
