## Task Summary

- Data analysis on my study.
- Routine task
  - [x] Learning English

## Done


- [ ] Bootstrap the result of constant method
  - do it tomorrow because I need extra information to do so.
- [ ] Calculate the deviance
- [ ] Summarize the results of subject selection.
- Watch LT

## Note

- Covariance variable
  - When we know the covariance matrix, we know the distribution of the data.
  - Main diagonal contains variances
  - Other elements (Cov[X,Y]) present consistency between X and Y
  - The diagonal terms converge to the variance of the data in each dimension, and the non-diagonal terms converge to their degree of agreement.

## Interruption at work

- nothing

## Coding Test

- Skip

## What to do tomorrow


## KPT

### Keep

### Problem and Try

## Free Space

Keep doing.
