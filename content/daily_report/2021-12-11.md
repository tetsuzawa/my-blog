Niseko is a famous ski resort in Hokkaido. The quality of snow is extraordinary. 
So people come from all over the world to experience that.  
Also, the view is great. We can see the Mt. Yotei from the slope.
The neighboring villages have been developed in recent years, with fashionable stores and hotels lining the streets.
