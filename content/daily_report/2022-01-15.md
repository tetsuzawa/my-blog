## Note

- How to getting started with eBPF
    - run BCC programs
    - run bpftrace programs
    - create bpftrace programs
- eBPF programs & maps
    - `bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD, ...)`
    - `bpf(BPF_MAP_CREATE, ...)`
- dist-packages vs site-packages
    - dist-packages is a Debian-specific convention 
    - site-packages is default name for python modules
- ptrace is a system call which provides ways to make parent process monitor/control other process's execution or investigate/change register.
