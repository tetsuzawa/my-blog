# Daily Report

## Task Summary

- Organizing and analyzing the results of experiments to be written for the paper.
- Routine task
  - [ ] Learning English

## Done

- Read
  - https://about.netflix.com/ja/news/how-netflix-works-with-isps-around-the-globe-to-deliver-a-great-viewing-experience
  - How the Netflix cooperates with the ISPs all over the world and create an excellent experiment.
    - Open Connect : CDN
- Watch
  - https://youtu.be/wYk0xPP_P_8
    - read heavy system
    - home timeline
    - user timeline
    - store into Redis
    - deliver new tweets from “tweeter’s” timeline to follower’s timeline on redis
    - If tweeter is celebrity, it takes much time to deliver tweet to all followers.
    - the solution to it is sharing the tweet by followers like infected .
    - how handle trends
      - splitting the words and analyze it
      - calculate the momentum by windowing the period
      - sort by geolocation
    - apache storm
    - kafka stream
    - cassandra
    - connect to server by web socket to notice new tweets


## Note

- binomial numbers
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/solution/
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient
    - binomial cofficient
    - nCr = (n;k) = n! / n!(n-k)!
- Catalan number
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/solution/
  - prod^n_k=2 n+k/k

## Interruption at work

- nothing

## Coding Test

### Unique Binary Search Trees II
https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/253/conclusion/2384/

#### Whiteboard

n = 7

l <= n <= r


```c++
vector<TreeNode*> generateTrees(int n) {
    
        for (int i =0;i<)
}
````

int find()
        

### Review

## What to do tomorrow

- Research
  - Check the result of pre-experiment and compare it to 0, 45, 90
  - Look for the data obtained by constant method.

## KPT

### Keep

- I watched a youtube of system design
  - took a note immediately
  - did it at top priority.

### Problem and Try


## Free Space
