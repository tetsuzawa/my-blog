# Daily Report

## Task Summary

- Working on a webapp for an online sound image localization experiment that will be used to collect experimental results for a paper due on December 20.
- Routine task
  - [ ] Learning English
  - [ ] Coding Tests

## Done

- Work
  - testify

## Note

- C++
    - Print a variable's type in standard C++
      - typeid(a).name() 
    - Need to define a function if I want to pass the variable as reference to a function.
      - The result of following example won't be string
        - cout << typeid("111").name() << endl;
        - A4_c
        - means char[4] or const char[4].

### Whiteboard

- Cases
  - nums=[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] 
          -2, 1
              1, -2
                -2=(1,-3), 4
                     3=(-1,2), -1
                       5=(4,-1,2), 2
                          6=(4,-1,2,1) , 1
                            1=(4,-1,2,1-5), -5
                              5, 4

  - sum_table[i][j] = 
    
### Review

- skip

## What to do tomorrow

- Solve problem P37 in the Algorithms and Data Structures book.
- Review the problem on Leetcode that I could not solved yesterday
- Solve today's assignment on Leetcode.
- Do technical verification that multiple binaries can be sent from the server to the client using multipart/form-data.
- Create UI of research WebApp
- Find out about traceroute.

## KPT

### Keep

- My physical condition was not that good, but I was able to refresh myself by jogging.

### Problem and Try

- I could not achieve to do routine 
  - I've put it off
