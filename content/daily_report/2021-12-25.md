## Note


## Coding Test

- https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/
- Did you solve it ?
  - No
- Solution
  - DP
  - Hold the minimum number of coins by remaining amount.
  - Choose the coin from coins and find the answer incrementally
  - Time complexity is O(Sâˆ—n). where S is the amount, n is denomination count.
  - Space complexity is O(S) for dp list.
