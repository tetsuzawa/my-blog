## Note

- SQL Antipattern 5
  - EAV (Entity Attribute Value)
    - Context won't be fixed until reading WHERE statement
    - Can not set required column
    - Can not use data type
    - Can not use aggression function
    - Can not mandate referential integrity
    - The attribute name must be complemented
    - When "OUTER JOIN‚Äù statement is multiply used on in one query, the time complexity will become exponential.
    - The number of tables that MySQL 5.6 can reference at one time is 61.
    - The maximum number of columns that a table can have is 4096.
  - Solution to adopting EAV
    - Single table inheritance
      - Add columns which is used by only certain attribute.
    - Concrete Table Inheritance
      - This is appropriate when searches across all subtypes are performed infrequently.
